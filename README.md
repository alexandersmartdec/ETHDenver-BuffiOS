## Freedom is **essential**. Privacy **Matter**!

### What is it?

- Easy and secure way to send money through Ethereum Networks 
- Easy swap Ether, Dai and xDai
- Send xDai quickly and secure
- Send Buffi token
- Lending platform

### So, let's go deeper into those statements:

### Features
- Support xDai
- Support classic Ethereum Networks
- Let you be **free from hard-bonded solution** like (`Laptop + Chrome + MetaMask + Private key`) binding. 
- **No private key sharing** needed! Store it at one place, sign anywhere!

## Purpose

We built a native xDai-based lending platform with user-friendly wallet, cross-application coordination (via deep links) to provide p2p micro-loans to users willing to buy goods in various marketplaces with borrowed xDai or lend xDai to their peers earning interest on the deposit of funds on our platform. Our model use case: if I have spent all my buffiDai coins on food already but still hungry, it allows me to borrow 10 buffiDai coins from another ETH Denver participant, who still has them, and return it as 11 buffiDai coins exactly one year later on ETH Denver 2020.

## Plans (TBD)
- More tokens swap
- Better UI/UX
- Provide p2p loans based on smart-contract

## Final Notes:

All in all, with all those things that will be implemented we will make payments easy, secure and fast
